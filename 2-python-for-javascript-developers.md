# Python for JavaScript Developers Notes

Learning Python as a JavaScript developer by comparing the syntax and constructs of each language with the other.

## Basics

**Versions used**
- Python version: `3+`
- JavaScript version: `ES6+`

### Data types

1. Numeric
  1. Integer (`int`)
  2. Float (`float`)
  3. Complex Number
2. String (`str`)
3. Boolean (`bool`): There are two values, `True` and `False`
4. Dictionary (`{}`)
5. Sequence
  1. Lists (`[]`)
  2. Tuples (`()`)
6. None

There are many more advanced types. 

Comparison with JavaScript:
- In python too, `int`, `float`, etc are internal representations of a **Number or numeric** type - same as in JavaScript
- In JavaScript, the boolean values `true` and `false` are **not** capitalized
- **Dictionary** is what we call as an **object** in JavaScript
- **Lists** are nothing but **arrays** in JavaScript
- **Tuples** are a special type of a list. They are like fixed size, immutable arrays in JavaScript
- `None` is an empty type when a function returns nothing. It is similar to `undefined` in JavaScript
- JavaScript has more built-in types: `NaN`, Symbol

### Type casting

1. Converting to a string: **`str()`**
2. Converting to an integer: **`int()`**
3. Converting to a float: **`float()`**

Other data types have similar functions

Comparison with JavaScript:
- Converting a number: `Number()`
- Parsing a string as an integer: `parseInt()`
- Parsing a string as a float: `parseFloat()`
- String conversion is usually done with string interpolation

### Variables

#### Declaring a variable

```python
variable = value
```

Example:
```python
my_name = 'Pushkar'
```

Comparison with JavaScript:
- JavaScript variable declarations are prefixed with a scope identifier like `var`, `const`, `let`

#### Data type of a variable

Python is dynamically typed i.e The type of a variable is inferred at runtime and is updated when the assignment changes
Example
```python
my_name = 'Pushkar' # string
my_name = 20 # integer
```

Comparison with JavaScript:
- JavaScript is also dynamically typed

#### Default value of a variable

Declaration comes with assignment. Both have to be done

```python
foo # NameError: name 'foo' is not defined

foo = 'bar' # ✓
```

Comparison with JavaScript:
- In JavaScript, it is possible to have variable declarations that are unassigned
- The value in such a case will be `undefined`

#### Re-assigning variables

Variables can be re-assigned in Python

```python
foo = 5
foo = 'bar' # ✓
```

Comparison with JavaScript:
- In JavaScript, only `var` and `let` can be re-assigned.
- However, `const` cannot be re-assigned (In fact, it has to be assigned a value at the time of declaration)

#### Variable naming rules

1. Only the following characters are allowed in Python variable names:
  1. Letters (`a-z` and `A-Z`)
  2. Numbers (`0-9`)
  3. Underscore (`_`)
2. A variable name cannot start with a Number (`0-9`)
3. Avoid Python keywords (i.e reserved words) while naming variable. Else, it causes errors.

```python
my_name # ✓
_my_name # ✓
my_name_1 # ✓
my_1_name # ✓
1_my_name # ✕
with # ✕ (Python keyword)
```

Comparison with JavaScript:
- These rules apply to JavaScript as well but with one difference: `$`
- `$` is allowed in JavaScript variable names and can even begin with it
- Every other rule is the same

#### Variable naming conventions

Python uses **`snake_case`** for naming things like variables, function names and so on as a convention

```python
my_car
foo_bar
```

Only class names use `PascalCase`.

Comparison with JavaScript:
- The convention in JavaScript is to use `camelCase` for variables, functions, etc
- Classes use the `PascalCase`
